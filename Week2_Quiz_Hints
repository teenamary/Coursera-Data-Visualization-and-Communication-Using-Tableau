## Hints for WEEK 2 Quiz
I have gotten stuck in week 2 for a couple of days and I have been so frustrated by almost all the problems in the quiz. 
I want to share my hints with you guys who have the same feeling.
Firstly, please clean the data according to the exercise, excluding dog ids with sign_in counts > 175.

**To clean the data**
1) unclick aggregate measures in analysis
2) rows: sign_in_count (sum)
3) drag dog ids into the marks card, detail
4) filter: sign_in_count < 175
5) select all the data, right click, then choose group
6) a new group (dog id group 1 here) has been created
7) put the new grouped dog id into filters from now on for the quiz

**Problem 1** 
1) rows: user id (count distinct)
2) filter: remove grouped dog id
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis
### 16,261

**Problem 2**
1) columns: country, dimension, breed
2) rows: total tests completed (sum), weight
3) filter: state - 37
4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

### They are all from Estonia

**Problem 3** 
1) rows: sign in count(sum)
2) filter: remove the grouped dog id this time, sign in count > 175
3) view all data
4) make sure to unclick aggregate measures in analysis

### They are all Shih Tzus that weigh 190 lbs

**Problem 4**
1) columns: dimension
2) rows: total tests completed (avg)
3) filter: dimension - exclude 0
4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### None of them. All of the personality dimensions have very similar completion rates.

**Problem 5** 
1) columns: breed group
2) rows: total tests completed (both avg and median)
3) make sure to click aggregate measured in analysis

### Toy dogs complete the least number of tests
Note:
AVG Total Test Completed: 8.461
Median Total Test Complted: 5.000

**Problem 6** 
1) columns: breed type
2) total tests completed (median)
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### Socialite

**Problem 7** 
1) columns: breed type
2) total tests completed (median)
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### All breed types complete a median of 7 tests

**Problem 8**
1) columns: breed type, dog fixed
2) rows: total tests completed (avg)
3) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### Fixed dogs complete more tests than non-fixed dogs in all breed types

### The greatest difference between the average number of tests completed by fixed vs. non-fixed dogs occurs in the Mixed Breed/ I
Donâ€™t Know breed category

**Problem 9** 
1) columns: breed type, dog fixed
2) rows: dna tested, total tests completed (avg)
3) 1: tested/fixed 0: not tested/not fixed
4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### DNA-tested dogs completed more tests than dogs that were NOT DNA tested in all categories except for the category of Popular Hybrids
who were fixed

### There was only one dog in the Popular Hybrid breed category who was DNA tested but not fixed

### The Cross-Breed dogs that were DNA tested but NOT fixed were mostly Labrador Retriever-Golden Retriever Mixes

**Problem 10** 
1) columns: country
2) rows: dog id (count distinct)
3) show me column: choose map

### N/A

**Problem 11** 
1) columns: state
2) rows: user id (count distinct)
3) filter: country - US
4) order the columns from max to min
5) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

### CA

**Problem 12** 

### ME,NC,ND,SD,WY

1) columns: state
2) rows: total tests completed (median)
3) filter: grouped dog id as shown in the clean data pattern, state: ME, NC, ND, SD, WY
4) make sure to click aggregate measures in analysis

**Problem 13** 
please refer to the the reading material provided in week 2

### Average aggregations are more sensitive to extreme values than median aggregations

**Problem 14** 
1) as above but set the filter: total tests completed < 19
2) as above (15)

### "There was a significant positive (p < .05) correlation between average ITIs and number of tests completed."
### "There was a significant negative (p < .05) correlation between median ITIs and number of tests completed."


**Problem 15**
1) to get the chart:
columns: total tests completed
rows: median ITI, mean ITI (all avg measures)
filter: total tests completed < 7
unclick aggregate measures in analysis
edit Axis: Fixed 0-10,000

2) key points in the linear function:
whether positive or negative: check the slope(the coefficient with median or mean ITI)
significant: p < 0.05 non-significant: p > 0.05

### There was a significant positive (p < .05) correlation between average ITIs and number of tests completed
### There was a significant negative (p < .05) correlation between median ITIs and number of tests completed
